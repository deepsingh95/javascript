// Javascript is synchronous
// single threaded - it can complete onlyone task at a time after the excution oc code then move to next line of code.

// both are default feature of javascript

// Execution context ==> Execution one line of code at a time

<!-- console.log(1); -->
<!-- console.log(2); -->

each operations wait for the last one to complete before Execution

<!-- call stack and memory heap -->

// blocking code vs non blocking code

// block the flow of program vs does not block Execution

// read file sync vs read file async
